👋 Hi, I’m Yash Bhojak

Greetings! I'm Yash Bhojak, a Backend Java Developer 🧑‍💻, also learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. I'm currently in my 4th year of B.Tech in Computer Science, I've spent a solid two years delving deep into DSA and Problem solving skills. My passion for learning and hands-on experience in hackathons and competitions have helped me to sharp my skills and knowledge.

Outside of coding, I find solace in the art of Music (Guitar, Keyboard, Beatboxing). You'll often find me singing songs. It's not just an interest; it's a valuable lens through which I use to relax, chill and lighten myself from the loads of work.
